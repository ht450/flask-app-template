# flask-app-template
My template flask app for quickly getting started with flask.

Run the setup script (windows) to set up the virtual environment and install the necessary modules, then you can delete it. 
(for mac and linux, replace `venv\Scripts\activate` with `venv\bin\activate`)

This app is set up using flask blueprints.
It has both a functional (home) and divisional (about) blueprint as examples. 
Delete whichever type you don't need.
See http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/blueprints.html for differences between them.
